<h4>Description</h4>
<p>The past decade has seen great developments at
the intersection of computational linguistics and language
documentation, particularly in the focus areas of
speech and video recording and transcription, best
practices for data collection and archiving, and ontology
development. TLSX aims to highlight the
application of techniques from computational linguistics
to the management and analysis of language data as
well as to less-studied languages or less-studied varieties
of well-studied languages.</p>

<p>The goal of TLSX is to further the state of
computational linguistics for less-studied languages by bringing
together researchers working at this frontier and
providing a forum for the presentation of original
research. We anticipate work both from documentary
and descriptive linguists interested in improving
technologies for linguistic analysis and from computational
linguists interested in theoretical issues such as
the application of data-driven natural language
processing (<acronym title="Natural Language Processing">NLP</acronym>)
techniques to languages for which there
exists relatively little digitally-available data.</p>

<p>To that end, we invite submissions in the areas
of computational analysis and management of linguistic data
from less-studied languages. We also welcome submissions
relating to the development of computational
tools to facilitate such analysis. Possible topics
include (but are not limited to):</p>
	<ul>
	<li>machine learning in scarce data situations</li>
	<li>multilingual grammar and lexicon development</li>
	<li>cross-linguistic applicability of NLP methods</li>
	<li>active learning</li>
	<li>transfer learning</li>
	<li>bootstrapping semi-automated annotation</li>
	<li>challenges posed by particular languages or
	phenomena to current NLP methods</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Invited Speakers</h4>
