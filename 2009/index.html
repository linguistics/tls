<p>Texas Linguistics Society 12 (TLSXII) is a graduate-student run
conference in linguistics to be held over November 13-15 2009. The
meeting's general session covers all areas of linguistic
interest. There are, in addition, two concurrent events: one
parasession and The 5th Workshop on Discourse Structure in honor of
Carlota S. Smith. The parasession has as its theme "Approaches to
Semantics and Pragmatics Based on Naturally Occurring Data,
Elicitation, and Experimentation." The 5th Workshop on Discourse
Structure in honor of Carlota S. Smith will focus on two areas of
research in which Professor Smith did much pioneering work: the
semantics of temporal location, tense, and aspect, and research into
modes of discourse. Talks for this workshop are by invitation. The
list of invited speakers and their schedules is available <a
