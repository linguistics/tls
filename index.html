      <h2>Remembering Nora England (1946–2022)</h2>

      <p>Dr. Nora C. England, beloved professor and graduate advisor in the UT Austin Linguistics department, Macarthur Fellow, and founding director of the Center for Indigenous Languages of Latin America, passed away on January 26th. Nora leaves a great legacy behind her, both with respect to her own contributions to the field and her sustained efforts to train and uplift Indigenous Mayan scholars. And of course, this does not speak to the deep personal impact she had on everyone who knew her on a daily basis. We invite you to join us in remembering Nora and celebrating her accomplishments.</p>

      <!-- ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY -->

      <div id="policy">

        <h2>TLS Anti-Harassment Policy</h2>

        <p>TLS is dedicated to providing a safe, harassment-free conference experience for
          everyone, regardless of ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, language, gender, gender
          identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, or
          age. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference
          participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at
        the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
        <p>Exception: Sensitive topics like discriminatory language and intersectional identity are a
          point of focus for this conference. Therefore, discussion of these topics or similar is
          encouraged both during events and between individuals, as long as it is done in a
          respectful and thoughtful manner that is sensitive to the issues people experience due
        to systemic racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination.</p>

        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination [including racial or
            ethnic identity, nationality, religion, gender, gender identity and expression,
          sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, or age]</li>
          <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
          <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
          <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
          <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
          <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        immediately.</p>
        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to
          take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This
        includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.</p>
        <p>Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear
          impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any
        participants.</p>
        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related
          social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities
        too!</p>

        <h3>Reporting</h3>
        <p>If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as
          soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value
          of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you
        make our event a better place.</p>

        <h3>Personal Report</h3>
        <p>You can make a personal report by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sending an email to <a href="mailto:tls.conference@gmail.com">tls.conference@gmail.com</a></li>
          <li>Directly contacting one of the conference organizers (Barrett Hamp, Lee Orfila, Taylor Joyce, and Venkat Govindarajan)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure your concerns will remain private
          at your discretion. They may involve other organizers to ensure your report is
          managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This
          can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring
          someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell
        anyone who you are.</p>
