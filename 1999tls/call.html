<center><h2>CALL For PAPERS</h2>
</center>
Issues of argument structure have proven to be of long-standing interest
within diverse subfields of linguistics.  The intent of this conference is
to bring together researchers working on argument structure from these
different points of view.  In keeping with the theme of the conference,
presentations that address the topic from the perspective of formal syntax
or semantics are encouraged, as are those that take psycholinguistic,
computational or other approaches.  This conference will thus provide a forum
for presentation and discussion of original research papers on various
aspects of argument structure.Abstracts are invited for 30 minute talks (with 10 additional minutes for discussion) on any topic related to argument structure.  Potential topics include, but are not limited to:
<blockquote>
   <img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> Theories of linking and theories relation argument structure and syntactic structure<br>
   <img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> Theories of case assignment<br>
   <img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> Lexical/conceptual semantics and argument structure<br>
   <img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> Computational implementations and models of argument structure and/or linking<br>
   <img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> Syntax/semantics interface and langauge acquisition<br>
   <img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> Acquisition of argument structure<br>
   <img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> Language processing of argument structure, subcategorization and lexical & conceptual structure<br>
</blockquote>
Abstracts must be no more than one 8 1/2" by 11" page, single-spaced, and in at least 12-point font (10-point for examples), with one inch margins on all sides. One additional page with references and diagrams, AVMs or tableaux may be appended if necessary.  All submissions must include the following items:
<blockquote>
<img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> 6 anonymous copies of the abstract<br>
<img src="../reddot.gif"alt="-"> 1 3x5" card with name, affiliation, address, phone number, email address and title of paper<br>

</blockquote>
