	Particle verbs and resultative constructions in German share a number of properties: particles and resultative predicates are adjacent to the verb in V-final sentences but are "stranded" in V1 and V2 sentences. However, there are also some differences. Resultative predicates may be topicalized, modified, or given as an answer but particles may not be.  The similarities and differences between these two constructions are the subject of ongoing research. Although the analyses vary as to the exact account, many treat the contrast between particle verbs and resultatives as a binary one. It is argued that resultative constructions are formed in syntax while particle verbs are formed in morphology. A resultative predicate is a full phrase while a particle is not. From this the facts described above are derived: only full phrases can be topicalized, modified or given as an answer.  There are, however, a variety of constructions that do not neatly fit into either of these classes. This calls into question analyses based on a binary classification. I want to introduce one subclass of constructions which are resultative in meaning but cannot be topicalized or given as an answer but can be modified. I will argue that the binary distinction mentioned above cannot be maintained. I will show that the 'tests' that are used to argue for syntactic or morphological status in these cases do not really test for this. I will show that all resultative constructions have the same structure. Their differences cannot be explained via the distinction between syntax and morphology but rather by lexical semantic properties of the base verbs.
