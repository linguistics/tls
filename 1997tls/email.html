<center><h1>   Email Submissions</center></h1>
Yes, we are accepting email submissions of abstracts!  We hope that this
will be advantageous to you and to us.  However, it is essentially being
done on a trial basis.  Given the range of software and hardware that may
be involved, as well as the nature of the medium, we request that you
follow the guidelines below quite rigorously for your email submissions--we
reserve the right to reject any abstracts that do not conform to these
guidelines or that appear in less-than-readable format.  (In other words,
the abstract committee can not spend time "fixing" things like fonts or
spacing.)  Therefore, we strongly suggest that email submissions be sent at
least a week before the deadline of October 17, to provide time to deal
with possible glitches.  If you have any further questions, please contact
us at <a href="mailto:tls@uts.cc.utexas.edu">tls@uts.utexas.edu</a>.

<center><h2>   Guidelines</center></h2>
<blockquote>
   <img src="reddot.gif"alt="-"> Send ASCII text only, preferrably as a letter (not an attachment) OR send an attachment formatted for Microsoft Word for Windows. (If you do send a
Word for Windows document, note this clearly in the mail message that it is
attached to, otherwise it may be opened in the wrong application.)<br>
   <img src="reddot.gif"alt="-"> Include a subject line on your email that says "TLS abstract."<br>
   <img src="reddot.gif"alt="-"> Do NOT send Post-script files--they will not be accepted.<br>
   <img src="reddot.gif"alt="-"> Do not use uncommon fonts or symbols (e.g., for data), as we may not have them.<br>
   <img src="reddot.gif"alt="-"> Avoid complicated diagrams and formatting that relies on spacing and tabs, especially if sending ASCII text.<br>
   <img src="reddot.gif"alt="-"> Include the following:<br>
<blockquote>
<img src="reddot.gif"alt="(1)">an indication of whether you would like to have your abstract reviewed as an oral presnetation or a poster presentation<br>
        <img src="reddot.gif"alt="(2)"> one anonymous "copy" of the abstract (Do not send 10 email copies!)<br>
        <img src="reddot.gif"alt="(3)"> name, affiliation, address, phone number, email address and title of paper <br>
</blockquote>
   <img src="reddot.gif"alt="-"> Follow the length and formatting requirements (one 8.5x11", single-spaced page in 12-point font and one-inch margins on all sides, plus one more page for references, diagrams, or data, if needed).  Please test this with your abstract before sending it as email.<br>
