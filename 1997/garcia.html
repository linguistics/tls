In this paper we propose to develop an eclectic approach to predicate selection in  small clauses in English, based on the interaction of the meaning and form properties of the syntactic encoding of the NP XP string, on the one hand, and those of the matrix verb in conjunction with the predicative phrase, on the other. With regard to the first layer, we  contend that the general meaning of the verbless clause encoding (after the omission of "be") can be glossed as the expression of the speaker's direct, personal involvement towards the proposition encoded in the NP XP string. As for the second layer, we argue that the more specific meaning comes basically in two guises, depending on the lexical paradigm of the matrix verb taking the small clause complement:  (a) the speaker's personal, categorical belief or opinion (with verbs of opinion and judgement), and (b) the speaker's direct/strong manipulation  of the state of affairs in the NP XP string, and/or a sharp order (with causative and volitive verbs). Therefore, we propose that the principles governing predicate selection in small clauses can be aptly characterized in terms of a two-fold modality contrast, namely, agent-oriented modality vs. epistemic modality. Looked at in this way, the only requirement, if any, for a given  predicative phrase to be acceptable in a small clause environment is that the phrase in question should lend itself to a categorical judgemental reading and to a strong manipulative interpretation.
