In this paper we investigate the resultative construction in Finnish and Korean, as well as a number of Germanic languages (English, Dutch, German, Norwegian).  The typology of resultative constructions appears to have at least the following four subclasses:<br>
<blockquote>
 	(i)  languages with virtually no (syntactic) resultatives (e.g. Irish, Japanese)<br>      
	(ii)  languages where resultatives are productive and have no fixed syntax (e.g. Korean, Tamil)<br>
	(iii)  languages where resultatives are productive, but have a fixed syntax (e.g. English)<br>
	iv. languages with productive resultatives and are constrained but not fixed syntax (e.g. Finnish, German)<br>
</blockquote>
	We argue that the Case resources of a given language impose constraints on the possible resultatives, producing the mixed patterns.  However, locality conditions on Case assignment and  predication relations cannot account for the rigid syntax of the  construction in English.  We show that the English resultative construction is not compatible with verbs that require more than one  internal argument.  A principled explanation for this generalization can only be provided if Resultative Formation in English involves a radical restructuring of the theta-grid of the matrix verb that turns it into a monotransitive verb that subcategorizes for a single object position, possibly in the form of a complex predicate.  In  effect, the fixed argument structure of the English resultative  construction prevents any extra internal argument from co-occurring with the resultative as well as requiring a "fake object" for unergative intransitives.
