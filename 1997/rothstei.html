I present a unified account of the meaning of predicational 'be'
which explains its behaviour both in simple predicational sentences
such as (1) and so-called 'agentive' contexts such as (2):<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td align=left valign=top> 
(1)
</td>
<td></td>
<td>
 Mary is very clever.<br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table>
<tr>
<td align=left valign=top>
(2)
</td>
<td></td>
<td>
(a) Mary is being very clever.<br>
(b) She made Mary be very clever.<br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
The account rests on identifying a fundamental aspectual dichotomy
between verbs and adjectives: verbs have a davidsonian eventuality
argument and denote sets of atomic, countable eventuality elements.
Adjectives have their denotation in the mass domain, and denote
sets of non-atomic states.  I argue that BE, like all verbs,
introduces a davidsonian eventuality argument, but that, being a
copula, it doesn't ascribe any property to that eventuality or
determine any participants via theta-marking. Instead it has the
role of mapping from the mass to the count domain: it takes as an
argument a set of states, denoted by AP, and yields a set of
eventualities which instantiate the set of states, in other words,
eventualities in which the states hold. I represent the meaning of
BE as in (3), where S is a variable over sets of states:<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td align=left valign=top> 
(3) 
</td>
<td></td>
<td>
$S$e.Inst(e,S)  ("$" = lambda)<br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
Eventualities, including those denotated by complex verbs of the
form BE + AP, have a number of properties which true states do not
have, indicating the 'count' status of the former; in particular,
they can be temporally located and counted.  <br>
<br>
     I show that the semantic distinction between the denotations
of AP and [be+ AP] allows us to explain the agentivity effects in
(2) as a pragmatic effect resulting from the interaction of the
small clause and progressive constructions respectively with the
semantic properties of BE.
