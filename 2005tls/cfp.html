  <p>The goal of TLS 9 is to provide a forum <span class=GramE>for  the</span> presentation of original research on <span class=SpellE>morphosyntactic</span> phenomena in languages that are underrepresented in the literature, that is, less studied languages and/or less-studied varieties of more-represented languages. We welcome the submission of papers on topics including (but not limited to): voice, case-marking, agreement, <span
class=SpellE>cliticization</span>, complex predicate formation, verb serialization, noun incorporation, morphological blocking, lexical integrity, word order variation.</p>
  <p>In addition to the above stated goals, the conference encourages comparisons between different theoretical frameworks.</p>
