CALL FOR PAPERS

13th Texas Linguistics Society (TLS) Conference
June 23-24, 2012
University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX

TLS is a graduate-student run conference in linguistics organized by the Texas 
Linguistics Society and the Department of Linguistics at the University of 
Texas at Austin. This year's TLS is co-located with the North American Summer 
School of Logic, Language, and Information and associated workshops and 
symposia.

http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~tls/

TLS 13 will be structured around two para-sessions: (1) formal semantics & 
pragmatics and (2) signed languages and meaning. While we strongly encourage 
submissions related to these themes we will also consider submissions on topics 
of general linguistic interest. We are additionally interested in overlapping 
research from related disciplines including anthropology, cognitive science, 
neuroscience, philosophy of language, and psychology.
