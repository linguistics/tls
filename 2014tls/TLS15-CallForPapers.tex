\subsection*{Call For Papers}

We invite papers from all areas of linguistics, but especially encourage submissions relevant to our special session.
This session will consider the importance of experimental evidence in theories of syntax and semantics, and focus on research that highlights the unique advantages of the experimental environment, as opposed to other sources of data.
