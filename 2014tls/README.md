## Debriefing / advice

I wrote up some general retrospective pointers about running the conference, below.

Looking back, here is some advice I would have given us:

* Set the registration deadline to at least a week before the conference starts. Maybe 2 weeks. It's useful / necessary to have a head count to know:
  - How many snacks / how much coffee to buy
  - How many places to serve at a dinner, such as the dinners that Aramark caters in the Union
    + Catering is usually reserved and priced by the number of attendees
  - Who to print nametags for
  - Who has formally registered and / or paid
  - Who to make wifi access cards for
* The website:
  - Should print compactly (Bootstrap makes this more of a headache than necessary)
    + To give to session chairs, so that they have the ordering of presentations, presenters' names and affiliations, and presentation titles
    + To give to keynotes and presenters if they want a paper copy
    + Or to tape up on the doors, as a sort of web kiosk on-the-cheap
  - Should have all possible information on it:
    + Room numbers for each session
    + Names of chairs for each session
    + Length of talks
* The "theme" should be called a "special session" as in the past, rather than the overall focus with some general talks mixed in on the side.
* Leave more space for the keynotes. The Q&A following a keynote is usually lengthy but insightful.
  - E.g., 1 hour lecture, 30 minutes for questions, followed by 15 minute break.
* Schedule a central conference-closing / thank-you session after the last presentations, even if only for 15 minutes.
* In the case that a co-authored paper and a singly-authored paper have a common author, require or strongly suggest that the co-authored paper be presented by the other author. (And clearly state this in the section of the call for papers (CFP) that mentions the dual submission policy.)
* Some talks will run short in the Q&A, but that's okay — I think a little downtime between talks is preferable to allowing presenters to sacrifice Q&A time in order to talk longer.
* Somehow, politely but authoritatively, state that presenters are expected to attend more than their session. Even UT students! First off, it's rude to the other presenters to show up for just your session and then leave. Second, it's stressful for the organizers if there's someone presenting on the last day of the conference and nobody has seen or even heard from that presenter since they replied to the abstract acceptance email months before.
  - Maybe by requiring registration / nametag pickup before the last day? In our case, I think shortly before noon on Saturday would have been great. I.e., the schedule / acceptance letters would say, "You must arrive before 12pm CST on Saturday to pick up your registration packet (sign-in and collect nametag) in order to present."
  - Unfortunately, Friday / early Saturday presenters would still be able to skip out as soon as they present.
* Saturday events lasted from breakfast at 8:30 am to dinner at 7:30 pm; 11 hours is exhausting, and not just for the organizers. I really enjoyed the camaraderie and discussion at that dinner, but only 75% or so of the TLS attendees came to it.
  - It would be hard to decide which of the accepted talks we should have rejected, but I think we should have set the threshold a bit higher so that we would not have had to pack so many talks into such a short timeframe.
* Reserve about 2 hours for lunch. Especially if there's something important after lunch, like a keynote. Especially if your keynote speaker is off getting lunch with everybody else.
  - Also, try to dissuade everyone from going to the same restaurant. Most of the restaurants on Guadalupe aren't prepared to handle 25+ people coming in at the same time.
* The wi-fi access instructions printed along with credentials aren't perfectly clear. Write up a supplementary guide, at least for Mac OS X users.
* Maybe ask volunteers to count attendance at each talk? It would be nice to have average attendance counts for all the presentations and keynotes, in reporting back to our funding sources.


## Notes

More generally:

* Parking on Dean Keaton costs money Monday through Saturday, and has a 4 or 5 hour max.
  - It's totally free on Sunday, though.
* Garage parking (San Jacinto garage is very close to CLA) is about $3 / hour, or $18 / day.
  - It would be useful for the organizers to have a parking space or two for the duration of the conference, since we have to use a car to bring in the Whole Foods breakfast / snacks / Tacodeli tacos.
  - Maybe look into ["Event parking"](http://gifl.me/University+Texas+Austin+Event+Parking+Request) next time?


## Preparation time

Some tasks must be done in advance, and others must be done just-in-time.

* Snacks / coffee / stationery: At the latest, go shopping the day before the first day of the conference (the day of is hectic enough already, even if the conference starts in the evening)
* Getting Aramark to cater a meal in the Union: Reserve with head count at least 1 week in advance
* Nametags: printing them can be a pain -- at least 1 day in advance, more, if you want color
  - Also, consider printing them on normal paper and cutting to size as needed, since we probably already have enough nametag holders.
  - But if you want to buy the proper perforated label sheets, the size we've been using is "Avery 74540" (US Letter paper size, six 4"x3" labels per page).
* Wifi access sheets -- send these to Leslie at _most_ one day in advance.
  - Internet access is not something UT parts with (or imparts) willingly; the system can only generate wifi credentials that are immediately active, so they have to be generated (and printed) the day of the conference.
  - Leslie has to input these one at a time, which seems painful to me, but it's a pretty quick process. She just needs the following fields -- all of which are required:
    + Full name
    + Email address
    + Affiliation (university, company, school, or anything else, really)


## General notes on conferencing

The points below are derived from notes I wrote down while talking to John Beavers about this TLS's topic / "special focus" on 2014-02-10. They do not necessarily reflect his beliefs.

* Theories are more interesting than the methodologies.
  - A conference focusing on "The Method of Collecting Data" would be quite a boring conference.
  - Regarding the theme, we (the committee) started out with "Experimental (& empirical) justifications for syntactic and semantic theory," which boils down to something not too far from "The Method of Collecting Data."
  - John countered by suggesting we pose a question: What can experimental data collection get us that other data collection methods cannot? (Which is certainly a lot more specific.)
  - This developed into a "special focus":

      > **Experimental Advantages**: the importance of experimental evidence in theories of syntax and semantics—research that highlights the unique advantages of the experimental environment, as opposed to other sources of data.

  - We decided to accept submissions from "all areas of linguistics", as had been the case for most preceding instantiations of TLS, but "especially encouraged" submissions relevant to our special topic. (In retrospect, we could have put more weight behind that encouragement by stating that relevant presentations would be given in series, while more general papers would be given in parallel, but we didn't have the schedule mapped out when we distributed the call for papers.)
* A consistent timeline is important to the reputation of the conference.
  - It should be around the same time each year, at least something like "between Thanksgiving and winter break"
  - Good examples: [BLS](http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/bls/), [CLS](http://chicagolinguisticsociety.org/)
* Top-notch invited speakers (the keynotes) are one of the biggest draws
  - Sometimes this is a matter of money (flights and housing aren't cheap)
  - How they operate at conferences is important.
    + They should go to most of the talks and engage the student presenters — asking good questions and offering constructive criticism.
    + I.e., they aren't _just_ showing up and giving their own talk, it's more of a job than that.
    + For these reasons, it's most helpful to get speakers whose interests overlap with the presenters'. Having a theme (or "special focus", as we called it), rather than just inviting papers from "all subfields of linguistics", provides some unification to an otherwise pretty extensive playing field, or at least informs attendees kind of where we're coming from.
* Having settled on a theme, look at calls for papers from other similarly focused conferences. They might provide ideas of who to invite, as well as ways to express our own call for papers.
