# Instructions

For now, the server does not mirror this git repository, so deployments are made in place by running the command below from this directory:

    rsync -r ./ tls@uts.cc.utexas.edu:public_html/2014tls/


## Github Pages

As we incrementally migrate the old sites to version control in this repository, they will also be served as Github Pages.
